# Association_Analysis_using_Apriori_algorithm
Apriori algorithm is the first association rule mining algorithm which used support-based pruning to control exponential growth of candidate itemsets.

The module
- can generate candidate sets based on Fk-1 X F1 method and Fk-1 X Fk-1
- generates association rule based on ap-genRules based on min support and confidence
- generates the association rules from the data-set

Modified the ap-genRules to include rules with one antecedent which was not covered by ap-genRules

Progamming Language:
- Java in Model View Controller design pattern

Module was developed only using standard Java libraries under JDK 8 and not by the use of any predefined data mining libraries
